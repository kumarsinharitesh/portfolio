HOW TO ADD YOUR PROFILE PICTURE:

1. Take the image you shared with me (the one where you're wearing an orange shirt)

2. Rename the image file to "profile.jpg" 

3. Copy this renamed image to EXACTLY this location:
   C:\Users\sinha\OneDrive\Desktop\gdg\portfolio\public\profile.jpg
   (This will replace the placeholder file we created)

4. Make sure the path is correct - the image should be directly in the "public" folder, NOT in the "images" subfolder.

5. Restart your development server by:
   - Stopping the current server (with Ctrl+C)
   - Running "npm start" again

6. Your profile picture should now appear in the circular frame on your website.

NOTE: If you still face issues, try clearing your browser cache or opening the site in a private/incognito window.
